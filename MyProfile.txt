I have also completed some online courses including Google's Machine Learning Crash Course, Harvard's Introduction to Artificial Intelligence and a Hands on Cyber Security course and numerous Kaggle data science mini-courses.

I am currently doing an internship with a charity called Insight Outreach that aims to break down the social barriers. I am remaking their website for a greater usability and also am establishing their internal use of technology so that the charity can have the most impact.

For the year 20/21, I have been elected to be the Hindu Society Treasurer. For the role, I have to find sponsors, manage the society's budget and also maintain a relationship with the Student Union as well as the National Hindu Student Forum.

I also play a range of sports, I played table tennis for my local club and I also discovered a sport called Kabaddi. Furthermore, I have also taken up the role of social secretary.

One of the best experiences in my life has been when I was accepted to the Virgin Atlantic's Be the Change Scholarship where I and a group of 29 went to a small village in India and built a school for local children. During the 3 weeks I volunteered, I developed countless skills and learnt a lot about how people live in poverty, developing projects to help social issues we face.

I was also part of the Air Cadets, where I was able to develop many skills which include focus, resilience and analytical skills to name a few. while partaking in many activities, for example, finishing a 50-mile walk and much more. Being part of the cadets was like no other as it gave me a different outlook and mentality.
